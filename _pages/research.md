**[Place-based Policy and Entrepreneurship: Evidence from Theme Park Openings](https://tpeng2023.github.io/tpeng.github.io/assets/files/JMP_Peng.pdf)** (JMP)\\
with Chun-Yu Ho

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Abstract: This paper examines the economic effects of large theme park openings in China from 2000 to 2020 using a newly compiled dataset on county-level theme parks and entrepreneurship activities. Leveraging the staggered openings of theme parks across various counties, we document three findings. First, theme park openings lead to an approximately 14\% increase in entrepreneurship activities, especially in tourism-related service sectors. This result is robust to the instrumental variable approach, heterogeneous treatment effect, alternative specifications, measurements, and selection methodology. Second, theme park openings generate spillover effects on neighboring counties within a 75-kilometer radius. Third, tourism and agglomeration are identified as the potential channels. Back-of-envelop calculations suggest that theme park openings promote employment by 11\% and overall economic activities by 2\%-3\%. This study sheds new light on the evaluation of the effectiveness of tourism-related place-based policies.

**[Air Connectivity and International Travel: Evidence from Cross-border Card Payments](https://tpeng2023.github.io/tpeng.github.io/assets/files/HoPengTakayamaXu.pdf)**\\

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Abstract: Many countries seek to attract foreign travelers. How do direct flight connections affect the spending of international visitors? A novel dataset on card payments made by Chinese travelers through point-of-sale (POS) terminals enables us to investigate that question. We instrument for the frequency of direct flights between Chinese cities and foreign countries by exploiting overseas airport expansions as exogenous shocks. Our IV estimates indicate that a 1% increase in the weekly frequency of direct flights leads to a 2% increase in cross-border card transaction value. This suggests that in a city with the average frequency, adding one extra weekly direct flight increases the value of transactions by 52% to the destination country. While improving air connectivity promotes international travel, we find that negative shocks to consumer preferences for destination countries, such as boycotts, diminish the positive impact of air connectivity.

**[Competitive Effects of Regional Airline Exit: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://tpeng2023.github.io/tpeng.github.io/assets/files/Airline_Exit.pdf)**\\
with Chun-Yu Ho, Patrick McCarthy, and Li Xu, under review

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Abstract: We examine the competitive effects of regional airline exits on the U.S. airline industry during the period April 2019 through December 2020, leveraging the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment. Using propensity score matching and difference-in-differences strategies, we find that, on average, consumers are worse off after the exits. When a market experiences a regional airline exit, there is a significant 16% decrease in flight availability with no immediate replacements and a rise in the average fare by roughly 6%. The adverse supply outcome is mitigated for longer-haul markets and markets dominated by full-service carriers. Turning to the competition dynamics after the exits, incumbent airlines expand their services and raise their fares. Competing regional airlines and airlines with greater cash reserves are more able to seize market share after the exits. Fares rise, but to a lesser extent for competing regional airlines. And the exits have less impact on-time performance.

**Endowment, Market Potential, and Spatial Dynamics of Industrial Locations: Evidence from Global Shipbuilding**\\
with Chun-Yu Ho,  Dan Li, and Zhijia Xiao, R&R
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Abstract: We compile a novel panel dataset of ship orders across 30 countries from 1896 to 2020 to examine the evolution of the global shipbuilding industry across time and space. We document a transition in the shipbuilding production location from European countries to Asian countries over the sample period. We further apply a panel error-correction model (ECM) to show that both relative capital endowment and market potential account for this transition in the long run, while market potential exerts a more significant influence on ship production in the short run.
